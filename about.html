    <h7> As the world becomes increasingly more accessible, the prospect of reaching the most remote and interesting places is no longer an unattainable dream. However, for a solo female traveller, this opportunity is greatly restricted by the need to feel safe and comfortable.

    Accessibility to female only dorms and/or private rooms
    Female staff available
